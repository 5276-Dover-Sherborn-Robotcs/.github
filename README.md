# Welcome to our repository!
This is where all of our code will be stored for the season! Although it might take a while to get used to if you're a new member, have no fear, github is a great rescource for programmers at all levels! Members can make edits and commit changes to files, but *Please do not make any commits to the website files without consulting a team captain or senior member first!* Thank you!

-Enjoy-
